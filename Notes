5. Structured output - json output
imp - > we can integrate these output with other programs/machines etc

Why is it imp/ Use case :
1. Data extraction -> Naukri.com -> name, skills
2. API building -> amazon reviews -> topics, cons, pros, sentiment
3. Build Agents -> Find sqroot of 2

Two types of LLMs ->
1. Can give structured output -> with_structured_output
2. Cannot give structured output -> output_parsers


1. Can give structured o/p
three ways-
1. TypedDict
2.Pydantic
3. Json_schema

1. TypedDict : from typing
to define dict in python.
1. what keys and the type of values
2. It does not validate it at run time.

class Person:
name: str

name: Annotated[str, 'Write down the summary']
name: Annotated[Optional[list[str]], 'Give the summary'] 


#Remember, it does not validate which means that if you want reviews > 3, it can still give reviews <=3.
or str instead of int etc....


2. Pydantic
is a data validation and data parsing lib for Python.
It ensures that data is correct, structured and type-safe.

Annotated -> Field(description = "Give summary")
name : Optional[str] = Field(default = None, description = " ")

Remember, it returns pydantic object so you have to convert it to dict or json(model.dump_to_json)

It is more powerful.


3. json_schema - multiple languages

{
    "title": "student",
    "description": "schema about students",
    "type": "object",
    "properties":{
        "name":"string",
        "age":"integer"
    },
    "required":["name"]
}
