6. Output Parsers

help convert LLM responses into structured format like json, CSV, Pydantic models and more. They ensure consistency, validation and ease of use in applications.

4 types:
1. str o/p
2. json o/p
3. structured o/p
4. pydantic o/p

We have other parsers as well but we will focus on these.

1. StrOutputParser

topic -> LLM -> detailed o/p -> LLM -> 5 lines summary
It is mainly used with chains.

2. JsonOutputParser

PromptTemplate(
template = 'Give me the name and city \n {format_instruction}',
input_variables = [],
partial_variables= {'format_instruction': parser.get_format_instruction()}
)


Remember, It doesn't enforce a schema.
Meaning,
Give me facts about langchain.
O/p -> facts : {o/p}
But what if you need it like {fact1 : },{fact2 : },....

It will not work for this so we need ..

3. StructuredOutputParser

helps extract structured Json data from LLM responses based on predefined field schemas.
It works by defining a list of fields that model returns.

Remember, data validation is not possible in Structured O/p.

Name, age - 35 years instead if 35 (int). We have ton accept 35 years here, which is why we use ....


4. PydanticOutputParser
is a structured o/p that uses Pydantic models to enforce schema validation when processing LLM responses.

Why ?
1. Strict Schema Enforcement
2. Type Safety
3. Easy validation
4. Seamless Integration
